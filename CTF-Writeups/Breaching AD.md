## **1. Introduction**

This CTF walkthrough demonstrates various authentication-based attacks in an Active Directory environment, highlighting weaknesses in **NTLM authentication, password spraying, LDAP pass-back attacks, and credential extraction from PXE boot images and databases**.

The simulated environment consists of:
- **Domain Controller** (`THMDC - 10.200.80.101`)
- **Web Server** (`THM IIS - 10.200.80.201`)
- **PXE Boot Server** (`THM MDT - 10.200.80.202`)
- **Attacking System** (Kali/Linux machine)

Network Diagram Provided to us:

### **Objectives**
‚úÖ Enumerate NTLM authentication mechanisms  
‚úÖ Exploit weak credentials via password spraying  
‚úÖ Capture NTLM authentication hashes via LDAP attacks  
‚úÖ Extract stored credentials from PXE boot images  
‚úÖ Analyze sensitive credentials in the McAfee database

## **2. Reconnaissance & Initial Access**

The first step was verifying if the **targeted domain name resolution** was correctly set. We configured our DNS settings to use the domain controller (`10.200.80.101`).

![DNS Setup](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_130420.png)  

Once configured, an **nslookup query** was performed to validate DNS resolution.

**Q1: What popular website can be used to verify if your email address or password has ever been exposed in a publicly disclosed data breach?**
üìù **Answer:** `haveibeenpwned`

---

## **3. Password Spraying Attack**

To identify weak credentials, we attempted a **password spraying attack** against NTLM authentication.

**Q2: What is the name of the challenge-response authentication mechanism that uses NTLM?**
üìù **Answer:** `netntlm`

We found that the NTLM auth requested a username and password
![Password Spraying Script](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_130548.png)  

Using an **NTLM password spraying script**, we tested a default password (`Changeme123`) against a list of known usernames.

![Password Spraying Script](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_130711.png)   

The attack was **successful**, revealing **four valid credential pairs**:
- **Third Valid Username:** `gordon.stevens`
- **Total Valid Credentials Found:** `4`

Testing one of the compromised accounts on the **NTLM-secured web application** displayed the following response:

**Q5: What is the message displayed by the web application when authenticating with a valid credential pair?**
üìù **Answer:** `Hello World`

---

## **4. LDAP Pass-Back Attack**

We found a printer settings page at printer.za.tryhackme.com/settings, which sends information to a server:

![Printer Settings](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_131411.png)  

We try to intercept using a **Netcat Listener** and changing the server information to our IP but only receive encrypted credentials:

![Printer Settings Interception](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_131538.png)  

Next, we targeted **LDAP authentication vulnerabilities** by setting up a **rogue LDAP server** to capture plaintext credentials.

![LDAP Configuration](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_131608.png)  
![LDAP Capture Setup](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_131702.png)  

Then, we adjusted the olcSaslSecProps.ldif to use plaintext credentials.

![Restart using configuration](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_131856.png) 
![verifying configuration](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_131916.png)

Then, we set up a tcpdump to listen for the credentials:

![tcpdump listener](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_131942.png)  

**Q6: What type of attack can be performed against LDAP Authentication systems not commonly found against Windows Authentication systems?**
üìù **Answer:** `ldap pass-back attack`

We allowed **`login` and `plain` authentication mechanisms** to force unencrypted logins.

Captured credentials:
- **Username:** `svcLDAP`
- **Password:** `tryhackmeldappass1@`

## **5. NTLM Authentication Poisoning**

To capture **NTLM authentication hashes**, we deployed **Responder**.

**Q9: What is the name of the tool we can use to poison and capture authentication requests on the network?**
üìù **Answer:** `responder`

![Responder Setup](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_132043.png)  

Captured credentials (Didn't get the original screenshot):

![Responder Interception](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_132158.png)

Then, using hashcat, we decrypted the user credentials:

![Hashcat](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_132234.png)


- **Username:** `svcFileCopy`
- **Cracked Password:** `FPassword1!`

---

## **6. PXE Boot Image Credential Extraction**

We would normally receive the IP for the MDT server via DHCP, but since it's provided in the network diagram, we already have it:

![pxe server](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_133627.png)  

We then ssh into the thmjmp1 machine using the password **Password1@**

![SSH connection](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_133720.png)  

From there, we create a directory for ourselves and copy over the PowerPXE script:

![pxe script](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_133754.png)  

Then, referencing the x64 file, we noticed in the browser, we copy that into our new directory:

![mdt file](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_133834.png)  

Now, we can easily find the path to the MDT image file, copy it to our directory using tftp, and extract any credentials.

![Image file](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_133903.png)  
![Extracted Credentials](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_134019.png)  

Using **TFTP**, we retrieved PXE Boot configuration files to extract credentials.

**Q12: What Microsoft tool is used to create and host PXE Boot images in organisations?**
üìù **Answer:** `Microsoft Deployment Toolkit`

**Q13: What network protocol is used for recovery of files from the MDT server?**
üìù **Answer:** `TFTP`

Extracted credentials:
- **Username:** `svcMDT`
- **Password:** `PXEBootSecure1@`

## **7. Configuration File Credential Extraction**

Upon enumerating the file system, we found a McAfee **`ma.db`** database and using scp, downloaded it to our machine.

![McAfee Database](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_134322.png)  
![scp Download](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_134343.png)

We then used an sqlitebrowser to enumerate the database and found credentials stored in the **AGENT_REPOSITORIES** database

![sqlitebrowser](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_134405.png)
![agent-repositories database](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_134427.png)

We then decrypted **AUTH_PASSWD** using a python script found at: ![Mcafee-sitelist-pwd-decryption](https://github.com/funoverip/mcafee-sitelist-pwd-decryption):

![Python Decryption](.github/screenshots/Screenshot_20250223_134552.png)

**Q18: What table in this database stores the credentials of the orchestrator?**
üìù **Answer:** `AGENT_REPOSITORIES`

- **Username:** `svcAV`
- **Password:** `MyStrongPassword!`

## **8. Conclusion & Lessons Learned**

### **Key Findings:**
- Weak passwords enabled **password spraying attacks**.
- **LDAP authentication** was vulnerable to **pass-back attacks**, exposing plaintext credentials.
- **NTLM authentication poisoning** allowed **credential interception and cracking**.
- **PXE boot images stored credentials**.
- **McAfee database contained stored credentials**, which were easily decrypted.

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
‚úÖ Enforce strong passwords & eliminate default credentials  
‚úÖ Disable NTLM authentication where possible  
‚úÖ Enforce LDAP signing & channel binding  
‚úÖ Restrict access to PXE boot files and encrypt stored credentials  
‚úÖ Secure configuration files by hashing and salting stored passwords
